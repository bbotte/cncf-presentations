# Linkerd Presentations

This is a community repository of presentations about [Linkerd](https://linkerd.io). All presentations here are available for you to remix and reuse for your own use. Pull requests are welcome!

## Table of Contents

- [Linkerd Meetup Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qseWDYWD4KzYFhb4bcp8WuDPYFVwB8sYeNnjCsgDUOw/edit). This is kept up to date with every release. Use/reuse however you like!

## Repo Organization

If you have your slides already online or hosted someplace else, just leave a link in the table of contents. If you want to submit actual slides to this repo submit your slides via a Pull Request, for now we're organizing by _author name_, so just toss them in a subdirectory under your last name.

**FORMAT**: We prefer if your slides were in a reusable format, such as Google Slides or whatever CSS/HTML/JS framework you prefer so it's easier to consume.

Please make sure your content is under the Apache v2.0 or CC-BY license so we can easily share and reuse the content.
